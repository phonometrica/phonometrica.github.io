<div><ul class="simple">
<li>firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,</li>
<li>secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it
is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and
holders of the economic rights over software.</li>

<h2>Preamble<a class="headerlink" href="#preamble" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
license within the framework of an open source distribution model.</p>
<p>The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for
users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.</p>
<p>In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
with a limited warranty and the software’s author, the holder of the
economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.</p>
<p>In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
the user’s attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
removed herefrom.</p>
<p>This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.</p>
<p>Frequently asked questions can be found on the official website of the
CeCILL licenses family (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html">http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html</a>) for any
necessary clarification.</p>
